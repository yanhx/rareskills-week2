# Wrapped NFT

# What is wNFT(wrapped NFT)?

A **wNFT (wrapped NFT)** is an upgraded NFT with expanded functionality such as economic set-up, on-chain royalties, rental mechanism, time/value/event-locks, protection of devaluation, and anti-fraud system.

# What might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?

## Trading at floor price

NFTs being unique is an advantage in some ways– you can have one CryptoKitty worth a few dollars, while another might have more rare qualities that make it worth a few thousand.

However, what if you wanted to take a collection of 1,000 CryptoKitties and exchange them for their ‘floor value’ — that is the minimum value that someone would buy them for on the open market. Normally you would have to list each individually and sell them one-by-one. Wouldn’t it be easier to have more liquidity around the market for a base value CryptoKitty so that you could trade them all in one transaction?

[WrappedKitties](https://wrappedkitties.com/) solved this problem by defining a token, WCK, for which you could 1:1 swap with a CryptoKitty. This in turn, has become a useful currency for the community, provides liquidity to the market and establishes a base floor value for all CryptoKitties.

## Fractionalized NFT

NFT can be wrapped and fractionalized into ERC20 tokens, and be traded with AMM DEX.

## Validated collectibles

One popular way for people to store their virtual goods is through individual wrapping services like Rare Bits. The service provides an environment where users can find scarce collectibles which have been verified and validated by experts so that users know what they are buying. It also allows buyers to securely buy goods from other collectors without fear of fraud or dispute resolutions.
